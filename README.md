# Convex Optimization
This repository provides implemented algorithms for several convex optimization problems. All code is written in Python 3, using NumPy and CVXPY. Jupyter notebooks are provided to show analyses.

**Note**: These are implemented algorithms and study for selected homeworks of [convex optimization course](https://inl-lab.net/convex-optimization) taught by Prof. Jafari Siavoshani in Spring 2020.

## List of Notebooks:
